# ESP32-C3 Super Mini Board

### Project Description

This project is a small development board design based on the **ESP32-C3 Super Mini**. Created for learning and experimentation, this board is optimized for interacting with wireless protocols such as **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE**.

**Note:** This is, for now, only a concept and a design. The board has not been physically developed or manufactured.

### Key Features

- **ESP32-C3 Super Mini:** A powerful microcontroller ideal for IoT and security projects.
- **Expandable SPI Connectivity:** Includes a dedicated pinout to connect SPI devices, though it supports only one additional device in parallel due to a single chip select (SS) pin.
- **Serial Communication:** **TX** and **RX** pins are available for serial communication.
- **I2C Connection:** **SCL** and **SDA** pins are directly connected to an OLED display, making data visualization easy.
- **User Control:** A **multi-way switch** (up, down, left, right, and center) provides intuitive interaction with the board.
